## [What are the requirements or prerequisites for taking your course?](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-eks-kubernetes-karpenter-devops-production/?referralCode=2C03B4D7B09AC0C806A0)

### **Required Prerequisites:**
- **AWS Account:** Active AWS account with permissions to create resources (EKS, VPC, RDS, EC2, etc.). Free tier works for initial modules.
- **Computer:** System capable of running SSH and web browsers (any OS: Windows, macOS, Linux). We'll use EC2 for Docker demos, so no need for Docker Desktop locally.
- **Basic Command Line:** Familiarity with terminal/command prompt and basic Linux commands.
- **Text Editor:** Any code editor (VS Code recommended) for editing configuration files.
- **Internet Connection:** Stable connection for AWS console access and downloading tools.

### **Helpful (But Not Mandatory):**
- **Basic Programming:** Understanding of basic programming concepts helps with microservices code, but not required.
- **AWS Basics:** Familiarity with core AWS concepts (EC2, VPC, IAM) is helpful but we cover what's needed.
- **Version Control:** Basic Git knowledge beneficial for CI/CD section.
- **Networking Fundamentals:** Understanding of IP addresses, subnets, and ports enhances learning.

### **What You DON'T Need:**
- **Prior Docker Experience:** We start from Docker installation and build to advanced concepts.
- **Prior Kubernetes Experience:** We cover Kubernetes fundamentals before advanced topics.
- **Prior Terraform Experience:** We begin with Terraform basics and gradually advance.
- **DevOps Experience:** Course designed to teach DevOps from the ground up.
- **Certifications:** No AWS or Kubernetes certifications required.

### **Tools We'll Install Together:**
- AWS CLI
- Terraform
- kubectl
- Helm
- Docker (on EC2, not locally)
- Various VS Code extensions

### **Cost Expectations:**
- Some AWS services used are not in free tier
- We optimize for cost throughout and provide cleanup instructions
- **Estimated cost:** $20-$50 if you complete entire course and clean up resources after each section
- **Pro tip:** Use `t3.large` instances (cheaper) and always clean up when not actively learning

### **Time Commitment:**
- **Course Duration:** 55+ practical demos
- **Recommended:** 2-3 demos per day at your own pace
- **Completion Time:** 3-4 weeks with consistent practice
- All demos include step-by-step instructions you can follow anytime
